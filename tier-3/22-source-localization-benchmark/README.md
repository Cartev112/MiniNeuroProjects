## Project 22: Source Localization Benchmarking

### Overview
Benchmark dipole fits and distributed inverses across SNR/regularization on simulated data.

### Instructions
Run simulation and evaluation:
```bash
python source_bench_cli.py --out_dir outputs/source_bench
```

### Learning: Forward/Inverse Problems
The EEG/MEG inverse problem is ill-posed; benchmarking across SNR and priors clarifies trade-offs in localization error and spatial spread.

## Project 3: ERP Pipeline for Oddball Paradigms

### Overview
This project implements an event-related potential (ERP) pipeline for a simple oddball paradigm: preprocessing, epoching, baseline correction, robust averaging, and peak detection (P300/N100). It outputs component amplitudes and latencies to CSV and produces publication-ready figures.

### Instructions
1) Install dependencies from `tier-1/requirements.txt`.
2) Use any BIDS EEG oddball dataset or MNE sample data with events.
3) Run:
```bash
python erp_cli.py \
  --bids_root /path/to/bids \
  --subject sub-01 \
  --task oddball \
  --event_id standard:1 deviant:2 \
  --tmin -0.2 --tmax 0.8 \
  --baseline -0.2 0 \
  --out_dir outputs/sub-01
```

### Learning: What is an ERP?
ERPs are time-locked averages of EEG responses to discrete events. Averaging across trials improves SNR by canceling unrelated activity. Key steps:

- Epoching: segment continuous EEG around events to form trials.
- Baseline correction: subtract pre-stimulus mean to remove slow drifts.
- Robust averaging: weights trials to downweight outliers and reduce artifact influence.
- Component quantification: detect peaks (e.g., P300 around 300 ms at parietal electrodes), measure amplitude and latency.

The code applies these steps using MNE, performs condition contrasts (deviant âˆ’ standard), and exports component measurements for downstream stats.
